### Summary

I've decided to use vue.js because I think it suits perfectly for this kind of exercise.
App is built with 2 components and 1 main app node,
Single file app so no webpack needed.
I've also used http-server for live-server during development

Some of the features applied:

⋅⋅* Applied module pattern to avoid poluting global scope with variables
⋅⋅* Images Preloading
⋅⋅\* Error handling
