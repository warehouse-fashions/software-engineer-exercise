I have created all what was required this includes- the landing page for the warehouse website- I have also built the modal which was required to display the lightbox modal. I used Jquery only as a last resort to implement the modal and carousel as using pure vanilla JS was causing an issue that made the Json images repeat across the all modal lightboxes. Jquery seemed to alleviate this issue.
